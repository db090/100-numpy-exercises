100 NumPy Exercises
A comprehensive collection of exercises to master NumPy, the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
About This Project
This repository contains 100 NumPy exercises ranging from basic to advanced level, designed to help you:

Learn NumPy functionality systematically
Practice array manipulation and numerical computing concepts
Build confidence in data analysis with Python
Prepare for data science and scientific computing work

Structure
Exercises are organized by difficulty level (indicated by stars):

★☆☆ - Beginner level
★★☆ - Intermediate level
★★★ - Advanced level

Each exercise includes:

A clear problem statement
A solution (which you can reveal after attempting the exercise)
Explanations where helpful

Getting Started
Prerequisites
pythonCopyimport numpy as np
Make sure you have NumPy installed:
Copypip install numpy
Running the Exercises
The exercises are available in multiple formats:

Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
PDF for reference
Python script (.py)

Exercise Examples

Import NumPy under the alias np (★☆☆)
Print the NumPy version and configuration (★☆☆)
Create a null vector of size 10 (★☆☆)
Find indices of non-zero elements from [1,2,0,0,4,0] (★☆☆)
Create a 3×3 identity matrix (★☆☆)
...and many more!

Learning Path
For best results:

Try to solve each exercise on your own first
Check the solution only after making an honest attempt
Understand why the solution works
Experiment with variations of the problem
